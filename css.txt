css have 3 types
1. absolute units - px,cm,mm etc (use px if want fix size)

2. percentage units - are mainly used for width and easy to understand .
   -> because it is relative to their parents (excepts on height    where things get weird)
   ->percentage width k sath use karo acha h 

3. relative units- em and rem



text align ->  ye apne parent k respect me center karta h
